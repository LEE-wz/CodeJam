# Relay Development Status

**Last audit:** 2026-08-29 17:40:48 UTC
**Audited commit:** `f3caed5` (contracts frozen at `ea469b2`, amended by the approved P1-01 and P1-05 mini-RFCs)
**Implementation branch:** `phase1-p1-17-service-matrix` (base `356c1e5`; one task branch per task, chained from `phase1-p1-06-artifact-parsing-order`)
**Current phase:** Phase 1 — In-Memory Walking Skeleton (implementation complete, verification outstanding)
**Current gate:** Checkpoint 0 verified; Checkpoint 1 awaiting its Docker Compose gate
**Overall state:** Phase 0 `complete`; P1-01–P1-06 `complete`; P1-07–P1-17 `implemented_unverified`

## Resume here

1. Run the standard Docker Compose `npm run check` from the runbook on
   `phase1-p1-17-service-matrix`. Expect **14 server test files and 237 tests**,
   plus both builds. Until it passes, P1-07–P1-17 stay `implemented_unverified`
   and Checkpoint 1 stays open.
2. Record that result in the verification log below, promote P1-07–P1-17 to
   `complete` if it passes, and close Checkpoint 1.
3. Review the Phase 1 implementation decisions now recorded in
   [`ASSUMPTIONS_AND_DECISIONS.md`](./ASSUMPTIONS_AND_DECISIONS.md) — especially
   the meaning of `sizeChars` — because Phase 2 persists artifacts and makes
   those choices expensive to change.

Do not begin P2-01 until Phase 1 is signed off. Do not connect Relay to real
Agents until the Phase 2 correctness and race gates pass.

For all resumed work: create a new task branch first, consult `FILESYSTEM_MAP.md`, clarify uncertainties before acting, run every test through Docker Compose, and require a passing Docker Compose `npm run check` before marking implementation complete.

## Last checkpoint

Checkpoint 0 is complete. Commit `ea469b2`, tagged `relay/contracts-v1`, freezes the overview-aligned types and interfaces, removes the accidental events route, adds all Phase 0 module shells and shared deterministic testing controls/fixtures/fakes, and proves service construction. The authenticated manual baseline and three-Agent checks passed against Phase 0 HEAD `d806e8f` at 2026-08-29 10:04:04 UTC.

## Phase 0 task ledger

| Tasks | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| P0-01–P0-03 | `complete` | Compose reports Node `22.23.2`, npm `10.9.8`; clean lockfile install and full check pass. |
| P0-04–P0-05 | `complete` | User-performed authenticated checks passed for the full temporary-Agent lifecycle, one Playground turn, three fresh Agents, one ordinary turn each, readiness, persistence, and isolation. |
| P0-06–P0-10 | `complete` | Scope/ADRs reviewed; contracts corrected; extra endpoint removed; terminal stop semantics frozen with tests. |
| P0-11 | `complete` | Immutable commit `ea469b2`, tag `relay/contracts-v1`. |
| P0-12–P0-17 | `complete` | Module shells, deterministic kit, shared fixtures/fakes, scripted runtime, and construction test pass. |

## Implemented inventory

| Area | Evidence | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Domain model/default policy | `apps/server/src/coordination/types.ts` | `complete` | Frozen against overview Sections 7–8 at `relay/contracts-v1`. |
| Component contracts | `apps/server/src/coordination/contracts.ts` | `complete` | Frozen overview boundaries include repository/runtime/workflow/context/protocol/redaction/execution control. |
| Coordination error envelope | `coordination/errors.ts`, `app.ts` | `implemented_unverified` | `CoordinationError` receives structured API envelope. |
| Service create/list/detail | `coordination/service.ts` | `implemented_unverified` | P1-14 adds slug normalisation of required sections, frozen title/key limits, and a create-time context-cap probe that builds a real probe prompt. |
| Background orchestration | `coordination/service.ts` | `implemented_unverified` | Scheduling, retries, runtime attachment, validation, commits, completion/failure, and local loop cleanup exist. |
| Stop handling | `coordination/service.ts` | `implemented_unverified` | Durable request, active-attempt cancellation, and finish-stop flow exist; terminal HTTP semantics are frozen, while race evidence remains Phase 1/2 work. |
| HTTP routes | `coordination/routes.ts`, `app.ts` | `complete` | Frozen list/create/detail/start/stop surface; accidental events route removed and tested as absent. |
| Phase 0 testing kit | `coordination/testing/**`, `construction.test.ts` | `complete` | Deterministic controls, full fixture pack, fakes, scripted runtime, and construction proof pass. |
| Pure workflow selectors/routing | `coordination/workflow.ts`, `coordination/workflow.test.ts` | `complete` | P1-01–P1-04 pass: deterministic selectors, all routing transitions, revision/turn ceilings, invalid-state guards, and exhaustive pure decision tables. |
| Strict artifact schemas | `coordination/schemas.ts`, `coordination/schemas.test.ts` | `complete` | P1-05 strict bounded proposal/review/final Zod schemas pass exact string/array boundaries, trimming, slug, discriminator, optional-field normalization, and unknown-field tests. |
| Artifact parser/protocol | `coordination/artifact-protocol.ts`, `artifact-protocol.test.ts` | `implemented_unverified` | P1-06–P1-08: frozen Section 11.4 order enforced as fail-fast steps (size, trim, one outer fence, one JSON parse, expected type, schema version, bounded schema, cross-field rules, backend provenance), plus the coverage/consistency rules and a 72-test valid/adversarial matrix including forged provenance and injected instructions. |
| Role-scoped context builder | `coordination/context-builder.ts`, `context-builder.test.ts` | `implemented_unverified` | P1-09–P1-12: Section 11.5 envelope, four role templates, the Section 5.2 visibility whitelist, canonical key-sorted serialisation, a reproducible truncation ladder with safe failure, bounded retry feedback, and leakage tests covering identifiers, bookkeeping, and superseded history. |
| Shared Phase 1 fakes | `coordination/testing/memory-repository.ts`, `testing/fakes.ts` | `implemented_unverified` | P1-13/P1-15: scripted runtime gains deferred, manually resolvable completions plus start waiters for race tests; the in-memory repository enforces lease, active-attempt, and status checks and returns deep copies so callers must reload. |
| Walking-skeleton evidence | `coordination/walking-skeleton.test.ts` | `implemented_unverified` | P1-15–P1-17: the real workflow, protocol, and context builder drive normal, reject/revise/approve, invalid→retry→success, invalid twice, timeout→retry, failure twice, start-failure, revision-limit, turn-limit, duplicate-start, stop-during-deferred, and late-result cases with no disk, HTTP, timers, or model. |
| Service/API tests | `coordination/service.test.ts`, `coordination/routes.test.ts` | `implemented_unverified` | Create-validation coverage added in P1-14; walking-skeleton coverage now uses real components rather than test-local stubs. |

## Outstanding by phase

### Phase 0

- Complete. No Phase 0 tasks remain.

### Phase 1

- Implementation for P1-06–P1-17 is complete on the chained task branches.
- The only outstanding Phase 1 work is the Docker Compose `npm run check` gate
  and the STATUS promotion that follows it.
- Not owned by Phase 1, and deliberately deferred: `attempt.stale_ignored`
  evidence rows (events are P2-05) and run-scoped cancellation (P3-04).

### Phase 2

- Database v2, explicit v1 migration, real repository, atomic leases/events, redaction, reservations, restart settlement, composition-root wiring, and race/API integration suites.

### Phase 3

- Backward-compatible Agent execution handle, correlated run cancellation, reservation enforcement, real runtime gateway, timeout settlement, real smoke flow, and timing evidence.

### Phase 4

- Web types/API, create form, run detail/timeline/artifacts, polling/stop, accessibility/responsiveness, and real browser verification.

### Phase 5

- Product documentation set, README integration, Agent/demo templates, rehearsal/fallback, clean release verification, security inspection, and submission commit.

## Verification log

| Date | Commit | Check | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-29 | `3d24d1b` | `npm run check` | **Blocked before typecheck:** `tsc: not found`; dependencies are not installed. Environment reports Node `18.19.1`, below repository requirement Node 22+. No test/build result may be inferred. |
| 2026-08-29 | `3d24d1b` | Static repository audit | Coordination files/routes/tests are present; `index.ts` does not construct/pass a coordination service; `JsonStore` is v1-only; `AgentService` exposes no completion handle. |
| 2026-08-29 | `docs/development-workflow-rules` | Workflow-rule documentation | Branch rule, filesystem access map, Docker Compose-only verification, mandatory final `npm run check`, and clarify-before-assuming rules added and verified. |
| 2026-08-29 | `docs/development-workflow-rules` | Initial documented Compose check | **Failed:** production image user could not remove a root-owned host Vite cache (`EACCES` under `apps/server/node_modules/.vite`). Verification command updated to isolate dependencies/build outputs in named volumes. |
| 2026-08-29 | `docs/development-workflow-rules` | Named-volume Compose check | **Failed:** separate workspace `node_modules` mounts prevented npm workspace scripts from finding `tsc`. Verification command updated to copy a clean, read-only source snapshot into one disposable workspace volume. |
| 2026-08-29 | `docs/development-workflow-rules` | Clean-copy Compose check | **Failed:** tar could not preserve host UID/GID metadata in the anonymous volume and the source snapshot was broader than the filesystem map permits. Command narrowed to npm/TypeScript contracts plus `apps/` and uses `--no-same-owner`. |
| 2026-08-29 | `docs/development-workflow-rules` | Scoped-copy Compose check | **Failed:** Compose sets `NODE_ENV=production`, so plain `npm ci` omitted TypeScript/Vitest development dependencies. Command updated to `npm ci --include=dev`. |
| 2026-08-29 | `docs/development-workflow-rules` | Final scoped Docker Compose `npm run check` | **Passed:** server/web typechecks, 7 server test files with 17 tests, web build, and server build. |
| 2026-08-29 | `ea469b2` | Focused Compose typecheck and contract tests | **Passed:** server/web typechecks plus construction and route contract tests. |
| 2026-08-29 | `ea469b2` | Final scoped Docker Compose `npm run check` | **Passed:** server/web typechecks, 9 server test files with 23 tests, web build, and server build. `npm ci` reported 1 moderate and 5 high audit findings for later security review. |
| 2026-08-29 | `ea469b2` | Live application availability | **Partial:** `/api/health` is healthy and `/api/auth` confirms authentication is required. Manual authenticated lifecycle/model turns were not attempted without authorized credentials. |
| 2026-08-29 10:04:04 UTC | `d806e8f` | P0-04 manual existing-application regression | **Passed:** health, Agent list/create/edit/stop/start, one ordinary Playground run, return to ready, message persistence after refresh, deletion, and post-delete refresh. Optional stopped-Agent message rejection was not checked. |
| 2026-08-29 10:04:04 UTC | `d806e8f` | P0-05 manual three-Agent baseline | **Passed:** three genuinely fresh Agents began ready with empty histories; Planner, Critic, and Finaliser each completed one ordinary turn; all returned ready; final isolation and readiness passed. |
| 2026-08-29 10:27:04 UTC | `bd691de` | P1-01 focused Docker Compose test | **Passed:** `workflow.test.ts`, 4 tests covering deterministic sequence selection and invalid candidate exclusion. |
| 2026-08-29 10:27:04 UTC | `bd691de` | Final scoped Docker Compose `npm run check` | **Passed:** server/web typechecks, 10 server test files with 27 tests, web build, and server build. `npm ci` continues to report 1 moderate and 5 high audit findings for later security review. |
| 2026-08-29 10:32:20 UTC | `eb6756a` | P1-02 focused Docker Compose test | **Passed:** `workflow.test.ts`, 10 tests covering selectors and all normal routing transitions, including revised-proposal precedence. |
| 2026-08-29 10:32:20 UTC | `eb6756a` | Final scoped Docker Compose `npm run check` | **Passed:** server/web typechecks, 10 server test files with 33 tests, web build, and server build. |
| 2026-08-29 10:34:53 UTC | `phase1-p1-03-workflow-guards` | Initial P1-03 focused Docker Compose test | **Failed:** 17/18 passed; the revised-proposal fixture reset `nextTurnSequence` below its committed turns and correctly received `INVALID_STATE`. The fixture was corrected without weakening the guard. |
| 2026-08-29 10:35:17 UTC | `6f03c3e` | P1-03 focused Docker Compose test | **Passed:** `workflow.test.ts`, 18 tests covering selectors, normal routing, ceilings, and malformed durable states. |
| 2026-08-29 10:36:10 UTC | `6f03c3e` | Final scoped Docker Compose `npm run check` | **Passed:** server/web typechecks, 10 server test files with 41 tests, web build, and server build. |
| 2026-08-29 10:38:50 UTC | `b0c1292` | P1-04 focused Docker Compose test | **Passed:** `workflow.test.ts`, 26 pure tests: 4 selector tests, 9 routing/limit table rows, and 13 invalid-state table rows. |
| 2026-08-29 10:39:39 UTC | `b0c1292` | Final scoped Docker Compose `npm run check` | **Passed:** server/web typechecks, 10 server test files with 49 tests, web build, and server build. |
| 2026-08-29 11:10 UTC | `phase1-p1-05-artifact-schemas` | Initial P1-05 full Docker Compose `npm run check` | **Failed at server typecheck:** Zod's optional `sectionKey` output included explicit `undefined`, conflicting with the frozen exact-optional `ReviewIssue` type. Schema output was normalized to omit undefined rather than weakening the type. |
| 2026-08-29 11:12:02 UTC | `162da1d` | P1-05 focused Docker Compose test | **Passed:** `schemas.test.ts`, 20 tests covering valid fixtures, every string/array boundary, whitespace, strictness, slugs, discriminators, and optional normalization. |
| 2026-08-29 11:12:47 UTC | `162da1d` | Final scoped Docker Compose `npm run check` | **Passed:** server/web typechecks, 11 server test files with 69 tests, web build, and server build. |
| 2026-08-29 | `ea15e37` | P1-06 final scoped Docker Compose `npm run check` | **Passed** (user-run): 12 server test files with 87 tests, both builds. P1-06 is `complete` on this evidence. |
| 2026-08-29 17:40 UTC | `f3caed5` | P1-07–P1-17 Docker Compose `npm run check` | **Not run.** No container engine is reachable from the environment the work was done in: the shell holding the checkout has no Docker, Podman, or Colima, and the alternative host is blocked from pulling `node:22-bookworm-slim` (403). Per the runbook these tasks therefore stay `implemented_unverified`; the check must be run on a host with Docker before any promotion. |
| 2026-08-29 17:40 UTC | `f3caed5` | Non-authoritative pre-check | 14 server test files, 237 tests, both builds pass under Node 22.23.2 / npm 10.9.8 from a clean `npm ci --include=dev` over the same source snapshot the Compose command copies, run outside the checkout. Recorded only to predict the Compose result. **This is not completion evidence and does not satisfy any gate.** |

## Known blockers and risks

| Item | Impact | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Shared ChatGPT context inaccessible in this environment | Possible decisions outside `overview.md` were not audited. | Copy any missing decisions into `ASSUMPTIONS_AND_DECISIONS.md`; overview remains current authority. |
| Code ahead of gates | Merged code can create false confidence about completion. | Retain `implemented_unverified` until required phase evidence passes. |
| Dependency audit reports 6 findings | Later security/release review must assess 1 moderate and 5 high findings without blindly applying breaking upgrades. | Review in the appropriate dependency/security task before release. |
| Current Agent cancellation is keyed by Agent ID | Could cancel unrelated later work after races. | Implement run-scoped cancellation in Phase 3 only after Phase 2 correctness gates. |
| Docker unreachable from the environment used for P1-07–P1-17 | The mandatory Compose gate could not be executed there, so twelve tasks carry implementation without completion evidence. | Run the runbook command on a host with Docker, then promote the task IDs. Do not weaken the Docker-only rule to close the gap. |
| Phase 1 implementation decisions not yet confirmed | Nine choices were made where the frozen contract is silent; `sizeChars` becomes costly to change once Phase 2 persists artifacts. | Review the decision table in `ASSUMPTIONS_AND_DECISIONS.md` before starting P2-01. |

## Decision log summary

- Code enum/API spelling is `finalizer`; user-facing label is “Finaliser.”
- `AgentService` requires a new completion-handle seam; `sendMessage()` remains compatible.
- `JsonStore` requires explicit additive migration; there is no existing hook.
- Routes register through optional `createApp(..., coordination)`; real composition in `index.ts` is outstanding.
- Real latency/schema reliability are measured Phase 3 gates, not assumptions.
- Terminal stop is frozen as idempotent `202` with explicit completed/failed/stopped route tests.
- The detail route is the only event retrieval contract; the accidental `/events` endpoint was removed.
- Frozen contract commit is `ea469b2`, tagged `relay/contracts-v1`.
- Approved P1-01 mini-RFC adds committed turns to `WorkflowView`; selectors order by `turn.sequence`, never artifact array position or timestamps.
- Approved P1-05 mini-RFC freezes numeric artifact field/array limits while retaining the separate raw-output cap for P1-06.
- Nine Phase 1 implementation decisions are recorded in `ASSUMPTIONS_AND_DECISIONS.md`; they change no frozen type, route, or persisted shape, and await confirmation before Phase 2.

See [`ASSUMPTIONS_AND_DECISIONS.md`](./ASSUMPTIONS_AND_DECISIONS.md) for full rationale.

## How to update this file

After each work session:

1. change the audit date/commit;
2. record the task branch and base commit;
3. move task IDs only when their required evidence exists;
4. append Docker Compose verification results, including the final `npm run check` and failures;
5. update **Resume here** to the next one to three executable actions;
6. record clarified questions, deviations/mini-RFCs, and new risks;
7. never record secrets, raw prompts/output, or lease tokens.
